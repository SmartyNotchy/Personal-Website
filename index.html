          Hi there! My username on most sites is SmartyNotchy
          <i> (which is a really awkward username that I picked when I was 7,
            but I've already used it basically everywhere so oh well), </i>
          so I'd much rather be called Pilliam in normal conversations. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm currently in high school, but I enjoy programming a bunch of side projects and games in my spare time.
          Although I probably won't release them as often as I did in middle school (because of, y'know, high school stuff),
          I'll definitely be working on some sort of computer science project most of the time! I guess I also play Terraria,
          Rhythm Doctor, and Celeste when I'm bored.

          I'm quite comfortable with programming in Python & Java, and I also
          know a handful of other languages like C#, C++, and HTML/CSS/JS (which was used to make this website!)
          I also have experience with managing large-scale projects, and developing
          a multitude of games, applications, and other miscellaneous applications.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also have some experience in competitive programming; I earned a bronze medal in the 2023 ACSL intermediate division
          and am currently sitting at a rating of <b style="color: #377e21">1290</b> on Codeforces.
          (I've linked my Codeforces profile below, along with all of my other connections!)
