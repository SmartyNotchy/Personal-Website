          Hi there! My username on most sites is SmartyNotchy
          <i> (which is a really awkward username that I picked when I was 7,
            but I've already used it basically everywhere so oh well), </i>
          so I'd much rather be called Pilliam in normal conversations. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm currently in high school, but I enjoy programming a bunch of side projects and games in my spare time.
          Although I probably won't release them as often as I did in middle school (because of, y'know, high school stuff),
          I'll definitely be working on some sort of computer science project most of the time! I guess I also play Terraria,
          Rhythm Doctor, and Celeste when I'm bored.
