          Hi there! My username on most sites is SmartyNotchy
          <i> (which is a really awkward username that I picked when I was 7,
            but I've already used it basically everywhere so oh well), </i>
          so I'd much rather be called Pilliam in normal conversations. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm currently in high school, but I enjoy programming a bunch of side projects and games in my spare time.
          Although I probably won't release them as often as I did in middle school (because of, y'know, high school stuff),
          I'll definitely be working on some sort of computer science project most of the time! I guess I also play Terraria,
          Rhythm Doctor, and Celeste when I'm bored.

          I'm quite comfortable with programming in Python & Java, and I also
          know a handful of other languages like C#, C++, and HTML/CSS/JS (which was used to make this website!)
          I also have experience with managing large-scale projects, and developing
          a multitude of games, applications, and other miscellaneous applications.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also have some experience in competitive programming; I earned a bronze medal in the 2023 ACSL intermediate division
          and am currently sitting at a rating of <b style="color: #377e21">1290</b> on Codeforces.

              Presleyn (aka Peter Zhao: The Game) is easily one of the biggest projects I've worked on.
              Set in our middle school in a fantasy environment where students resolve conflicts with magic,
              Presleyn still contains two acts filled with multiple battles, quests, a gripping
              storyline, and over 50 unique spells, wands, and other items.
              <br>
              <br>
              Giving credit where it's due, I mainly worked on the backend & frameworks for this project;
              most if not all of the content & storylines were planned by my friends
              <a class="connection_link" href="https://replit.com/@Unequip">Akash</a>
              and <a class="connection_link" href="https://replit.com/@SchoolDucc">Arjun</a>, go check them out!
              This project definitely wouldn't have been possible without them.

              RRBS is a JSAB-inspired bullet hell baesd on the iconic Never Gonna Give You Up.
              I started and finished this project in sixth (6th!) grade as a joke, and it was my first
              major project in terms of scale & planning.
              <br>
              <br>
              Although in retrospect it was pretty badly implemented and there were a lot of areas
              for improvement, this project holds a special place in my heart as the first major
              computer science project I'd attempted and successfully completed.
              <br>
              <br>
              (For anyone who actually tries to beat this, which I would strongly recommend not doing,
              there isn't any JSAB dashing. Sorry...)
